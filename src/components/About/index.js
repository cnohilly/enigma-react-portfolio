        Hello, my name is Chris and I am a full-stack web developer and programmer from New York. I have a strong interest in the back-end but overall just enjoy being given a problem to solve. I am always interested to learn and attempt new things when working on projects and often will look for better solutions than ones I already know. Through my Computer Science degree, I gained a solid basis of fundamentals and programming knowledge; in addition, Rutgers' Coding Bootcamp furthered these principles and gave me the skills necessary of a full-stack developer.
